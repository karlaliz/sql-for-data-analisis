#Select the id, account_id, and total variable from the orders table, then create a column called total_rank that ranks this total amount of paper ordered (from highest to lowest) for each account using a partition. Your final table should have these four columns.


SELECT id, account_id, total, 
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY total DESC) AS total_rank
FROM orders

SELECT id,
       account_id,
       standard_qty,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id) AS dense_rank,
       SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id) AS sum_std_qty,
       COUNT(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id) AS count_std_qty,
       AVG(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id) AS avg_std_qty,
       MIN(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id) AS min_std_qty,
